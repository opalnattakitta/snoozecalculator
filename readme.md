Are you a Snoozer? Why is it so hard to wake up in the morning? 
No matter how early I go to bed, when my alarm goes off, instead of jumping out of bed, I hit snooze again and again. 

Most sleep calculators focus on when to go to bed or how many sleep cycles you need, but hardly anyone talks about what happens after the alarm goes off. When I started this project, I tracked my own wake-up habits not just when I woke up, but how long it actually took me to get out of bed. Turns out, I need around 20–30 minutes and three snoozes before my brain really kicks in.

That’s why I built the Snoozer Calculator to help people like me plan not just their sleep, but their wake-up pattern, so mornings feel a more smooth and less moody.
